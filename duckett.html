            <ui>
                <li>
                    The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
                    different parts of a web page and help to describe
                    its structure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The new elements provide clearer code (compared
                    with using multiple <div> elements). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
                    elements need to be told which elements are
                    block-level elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
                    (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
                    which is available free from Google.
                </li>

            </ui>

                    You can add comments to your code between the

                <li>
                    The id and class attributes allow you to identify
                    particular elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <div> and "<span>" elements allow you to group
                        block-level and inline elements together.

                <li>
                    The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
                    information about your web page.
